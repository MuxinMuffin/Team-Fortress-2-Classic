# Team-Fortress-2-Classic
Hello!

This repo will host everything related to Team Fortress 2 Classic (maps, instances, props, textures, etc.)

# Notes
As of now this is a public repo.

# Terms of Use
1) For Team Fortress 2 only, you are allowed to upload derivatives of my work on the Steam Workshop, you may upload anywhere else too.
2) All map uploads should state that it is unaffiliated with the official map in its description, as well as a link to the Steam Workshop original map (if there is none, no link is required).
3) You must add your own suffix after the official filename. Official example: rp_stmonika_v1a, can be suffixed as rp_stmonika_v1a_myedit. Do not name it in a way as if it were an official version of the map, such as rp_stmonika_v1b, v2, etc)
4) If you are porting a map to a new gamemode (ex: szf_sugarmill_v2 to Slender Fortress), you are allowed to name it as you wish (ex: slender_sugarmill, slender_sugarmill_v1).
5) Do not try to profit from the vmf or any shared work here.

I don't recommend editing my maps unless you know what you're doing.
I will not provide help for the hundreds of possible errors you could face trying to change anything meaningful.
Assets not included can be extracted using BSPSource and your own wit to help you.
Beyond that, you can use my VMF to learn for yourself, I encourage it.
